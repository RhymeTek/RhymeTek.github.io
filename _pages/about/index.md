            Our first step is to build a weblog which not only collates posts from multiple social networks and blogging platforms but also enhance individual posts by the deep connectivity of hyperlinks, embeds, author's information, location information, image caching, image recognition, cross-posting, SEO, translation, and much more. Unlike traditional blogging platforms which are manually edited and maintained.

            Rime is an AI-based personal website building platform, helps you to collect posts from multiple social networking services, such as Instagram, Tumblr, Flickr, LinkedIn, Vimeo, Youtube, facebook etc into one simple, intelligent and beautiful page. It's an online diary for your internet life, your persona of the World Wide Web.

            Startups and companies can use this Weblog on their website to inform their visitor about their activities on the web. It helps them to build better SEO for their company without spending time and money on technology.

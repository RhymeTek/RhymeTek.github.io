Did you know Superheros are in Rime now! April madness couldn’t have been better as we saw Batman, Joker, Ironman and Minions joining Rime. But it was more interesting to follow Batman’s and Joker’s Twitter and Facebook arguments from Rime. As expected Tony Stark’s super model fan base dazzled us and Minions were very funny as hell with their posts. Still don’t believe us? check yourself links are below:

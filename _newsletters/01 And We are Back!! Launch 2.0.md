Hi {{ _to_name }} (@{{ _to_username }}), Team Rime would like to thank you all for joining us in beta phase of Rime.
Your feedback’s and support constantly helped us to build a better platform.

We have been working hard and It took more than 6 months to our team to revamp our core and rebuild our improved back-end. Rime is now packed with new features:

- Auto Syncing of your content from connected platforms
- Timeline: your content in timeline style @{username}
- Now Comment or Like on any URL.

Take a look in at your new Rime profile.

Stay tuned.
Christmas is coming… with lot more features :)

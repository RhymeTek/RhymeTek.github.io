Hi {_to_name} (@{_metadata_username}),
We are not going to be yet another social media that asks you to create new password to login to Rime because we believe remembering passwords is a thing of past. Instead, just use your authenticated social media login, and enjoy.
Facing any troubles? Let us know.
Thanks!
â€” The Rime (@rime) Team

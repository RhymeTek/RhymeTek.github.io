<h1 class="mdl-typography--font-light">Refund Policy</h1>

<p>As a company policy, we do not issue refunds unless a system malfunction caused a problem or your account was terminated without cause.</p>

<p>In this article, you will learn about refund policy.</p>

<h3 class="mdl-typography--font-light">Compliance Issues</h3>

<p>We do not provide refunds for Monthly Plans or unused Pay As You Go credits on accounts that were terminated due to a compliance issue.</p>

<p>Be sure to read and understand our Terms of Use and Acceptable Use Policy before you send an email campaign with Rime. We reserve the right to disable or deactivate any account if our Compliance Team finds that a user has abused our system in any way.</p>

<h3 class="mdl-typography--font-light">Chargebacks</h3>

<p>When you request a chargeback, the bank that issues your credit card reverses a payment you made to Rime, and sending is disabled in your account. To resolve the chargeback and re-enable sending, navigate to the <a href="#">Monthly plans or credits</a> page, and re-purchase your order. </p>

<h3 class="mdl-typography--font-light">Request a Refund</h3>

<p>The refund policy in our Terms of Use states:</p>

<blockquote style="font-size: 1.2em;">You or Rime may terminate this Agreement at any time and for any reason by giving Notice to the other party. We may suspend our Service to you at any time, with or without cause. If we terminate your account without cause, we’ll refund a prorated portion of your monthly prepayment or reimburse you for unused Email Credits. We won’t refund or reimburse you if there’s cause, like a violation of these Terms or our Acceptable Use Policy.</blockquote>
